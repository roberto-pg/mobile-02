All About Firebase - Full App

This application was created by Jacob Moura, from Flutterando, to teach how to use Firebase together with Bloc

As I don't like working with Firebase, I removed it from the project and I'm using socket-io-client to display the changes coming from Postgres in real time

### Thanks to:
